Movie Recommendation System
Overview
This project implements a Movie Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering techniques. It predicts user preferences based on historical rating data and suggests personalized movie recommendations.

Features
Personalized Recommendations – Suggests movies based on user interests

Collaborative Filtering – Uses matrix factorization (SVD, ALS)

Content-Based Filtering – Recommends movies based on genre & description

Hybrid Approach – Combines multiple recommendation techniques

User-Friendly Web Interface – Built with Flask & Streamlit

Technologies Used
Machine Learning: Collaborative Filtering, Matrix Factorization (SVD, ALS)

Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Surprise

Web Framework: Flask / Streamlit

Dataset: MovieLens Dataset

Installation & Setup

Dataset Used
MovieLens 100K Dataset: Contains 100,000 ratings from 1,000 users across 1,700 movies.

Format:

userId, movieId, rating, timestamp

movieId, title, genres

Recommendation Techniques
User-User Collaborative Filtering – Suggests movies based on similar users

Item-Item Collaborative Filtering – Finds similar movies based on past interactions

Matrix Factorization (SVD, ALS) – Decomposes user-movie rating matrix

Content-Based Filtering – Uses movie descriptions, genres for recommendations

Demo Usage
Enter a movie name

Get personalized recommendations

See similar movies based on user preferences

Future Enhancements
Deep Learning Approach – Use Neural Networks (Autoencoders, Transformers)

Hybrid Recommendations – Combine collaborative & content-based filtering

Deploy on Cloud – Host the system using AWS/GCP/Heroku
